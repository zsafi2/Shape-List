Project Summary
Computers repeatedly refresh and redraw images to a screen. In this project we are going to implement a very simplified drawing canvas to mimic this storage of items to be drawn to the screen. We will implement a CanvasList class in C++ that maintains a linked list of shapes that will be "drawn" when the draw function is invoked. We will also implement a Shape class that has three derived classes Circle, RightTriangle, and Rectangle. 


The project is designed to cover object oriented programming with test driven development. Throughout the implementation of the project you will craft and use multiple, develop test cases in either the Catch or Google Test framework, and work with and alter a provided main program that will help understand the usage of the objects you are creating.
